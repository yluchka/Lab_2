# Map Web Project

The program consists of two modules. 
The module is responsible for creating a map showing countries and up to ten nearby locations for filming. 
The user can enter their latitude and longitude and year of filming.

## Requirements

This module requires additional non built-in python libraries.
* folium
* mpu
* geopy

## Short theoretical info about HTML
To begin with, it is important to keep in mind, that HTML is not a programming language. Basically, it just says a web browser what and where to place. Here are its main responsibilities.
* marking the structure of the text: headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, quotes and more;
* retrieve information from the WWW via hyperlinks;
* creation of forms, in which the user can input his own information;
* place images, sound, video, and other objects in text.

The main tags are **<html>** which marks the beginning of the HTML file, **<head>** which is responsible for tab heading, and **<body>** which contains the main information. As mentioned above, there are also many other tags which are responsible for many other functions.

## Conclusions
This module can be used, for example, in entertainment. You can also analyze locations for filming.
